# IT2351-Week6
# Executive Summary
For this week, we will be creating our first stored programs, then call them and get the outcome we want, 
# Stored Programs
The first stored program I declared a variable from the products table then used an if statment to say if the number was greater than or equal to 17 or less than 17. I used primarily the one note attached to figure this stored program out.
The second stored program I inserted "flute" into the existing "categories" table. I did a fair share of internet research to try to understand this one.
Lastly, I created a stored function and then attempted to call that function into a stored program. This one gave me the most issues and I used a lot of internet research as well as the one notes to try to make this one work.
# Conclusion
This week was easier to comprehend for me than the subqueries and I think I was able to get a basic understanding of how stored programs work. We were able to make a basic stored program, I stored program that inserted a new item in an existing table, and how to create a stored function and then call that function for a stored program.
